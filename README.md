This is a repository for code that can perform pixel-by-pixel SED fitting on a JADES galaxy with BAGPIPES. It can also analyze the results from all of these pixel fits and make spatially-resolved 
maps of properties such as stellar mass, star formation rate, and dust attenuation. This code is not fully organized and commented, but for an overview of the project and its aims, a slideshow is 
included that provides this information (see 'High Redshift Bursty Star Formation.pdf').
